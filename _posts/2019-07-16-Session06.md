### 3D Printing an Air Hose Connector

Rather than spending the five dollars needed to buy one of these connectors, I decided to try to 3D print my own by designing it in Fusion 360:

I then converted this model into an .stl file, and then used the Cura program to convert it into an Ultimaker file. I then used an SD card to give this file to the Ultimaker 3D printer:

	<source src="fab1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Unfortunately, the finished part leaked air and did not serve as a suitable replacement for the part I can buy. I will try again on Friday using a thicker tube diameter to see if this will prevent leaking.

### 3D Printing a Mold for the Soft Gripper

The existing soft gripper did not pump air uniformly into its four fingers, which I suspect is a result of imperfections due to the silicone not being distributed uniformly during the molding process. To fix this problem, I decided to 3D print my own mold, which should be much more rigid compared to the cardboard and hot-glue mold suggested by the Soft Robotics Toolkit website.

Luckily, I found that someone had already conveniently designed a mold for this very gripper and freely offered the .stl file on [their blog](https://www.instructables.com/id/Air-Powered-Soft-Robotic-Gripper/). Therefore, it was just a matter of converting this file using Cura and feeding it into the Prusa 3D printer:

Hopefully, I will be able to cast the mold itself on Friday.
