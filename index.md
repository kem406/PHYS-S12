### 01: Introduction & Documentation

**Assignment:**

Create a website and sketch up an idea for a possible final project.

You will use this website to document your work for the rest of the semester. You are welcome to use any tools you'd like to accomplish this, but if you don't have any previous web development experience, you'll likely want to stick with the Jekyll template we covered in class. You're encouraged to use the HTML and CSS techniques we covered in class to cutomize your site -- even better if you research new techniques and make a novel website. You can also continue to update your website styling/layout for the rest of the semester. The goal for this week is to make the site functional, i.e., that you're able to use it to host your assignments in a way that others are able to find them. Please make sure your website is up and running, including your final project idea by this Thursday.

Your website must include:

- An index.html page that contains links to each assignment page
- An "About" page, including a short paragraph about yourself (hobbies, interests, and why you're taking this course)
- Some customization using HTML and CSS
- A final project proposal (you can use the Final Project page of the template)

Feel free to discuss final project ideas with the teaching staff and with each other. The projects we showed at the beginning of class might give you an idea of the range of possibilities. It's okay to propose something ambitious; the teaching staff will work with you to scale your idea to a tractable amount of work for the course. Take a look through all the topics we'll cover. Final projects should integrate most of the skills covered over the semester, including at a minimum:

- 3D design and fabrication (either mold/cast, 3D print, lasercut, etc.)
- Electronics (input and output)
- Microcontroller programming

### 02: Basic tools, procedures, and electronics

**Assignment:**

- Cut pieces from two different materials and join them. Document this.
- Add a fabricated component to a circuit, so that it does something (motion or light).
- Use a multimeter to measure the behavior of your circuit. Document your work and learning.
- Sign up for a free student Fusion 360 account with Autodesk
