Hi, I'm Ken. I'm a computer science concentrator on my way towards getting a degree at Harvard.

This is my personal webpage for PHYS S-12: Introduction to Digital Fabrication. I will use it to document my assignments, as well as my progress on my final project.

I am highly interested in both physics and robotics, which motivated me to take this class.
