### Website Design

Using the Jekyll theme that was provided to us, I constructed an [index.html](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/index.html) and [about](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/about/) page. The index page does not appear to be any different from my [normal home page](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/), but it still conveniently lists the links to all my assignments.

I customized my website using Matt Graham's [Leap Day theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/) for Github pages. I did a bit of tweaking by replacing some of the images and changing some of the links built into the theme. In particular, I changed the "View on Github" button, which normally links to my changelog page, to say "About" and link to my about page. In other words, this:

```
<a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}" class="button fork"><strong>View On GitHub</strong></a>
```

was changed to this:

```
<a href="https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/about/" class="button fork"><strong>About</strong></a>  
```

### Final Project Proposal

Inspired by [Nathan Melenbrink's](http://nathanmelenbrink.com/) explanation of soft robotics and their usage around coral reefs, I wanted to try making my own soft robotic gripper and attach it to a pneumatic robotic arm, similar to the one that appears in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lF_mJf8uo&t=1m11s) video.

The "gimmick" of this robot is that its physical movement will be entirely driven by air, as opposed to electromagnetic motors. I can use the McKibben Actuators that [Rob](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/) made and activate them using solenoid air valves, and the soft robotic gripper (details of which can be found [here](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/resources-for-educators/soft-gripper)) can be inflated using an air pump motor.  

Here is a sketch I made showcasing a possible configuration of the robot arm:

I will document the progress of my pneumatic arm on the [Final Project page](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/12/).
