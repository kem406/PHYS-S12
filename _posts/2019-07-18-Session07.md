# 07: Electronic Input Devices

### Assignment

Make a sensor to measure a physical quantity with the Arduino. Calibrate your sensor. Show data in the form of a table or graph.

### Using a Solenoid Air Valve

Using the [three-pronged air hose connector I 3D printed](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06/), I was able to implement the solenoid air valve into a pressure release mechanism:

</video>

In conjunction with the air pump motor, this allows me to control the air pressure inside an object at will.

### Building a MacGyver Air Pressure Sensor

Using a balloon, two pieces of wood, two pieces of cardboard, some copper foil, four dowels, four heavy lugnuts, and some tape, I was able to improvise this air pressure sensor:

The two pieces of copper foil are taped between the two pieces of cardboard, acting as a parallel plate capacitor.

When the balloon expands \(i.e. the air pressure increases\), the energy between the plates increases, as you can see in the graph from the following video:

The Arduino program I used for this sensor is the Capacitance program Rob created:

~~~
//rx_tx02  Robert Hart Mar 2019.
//  Program to use transmit-receive across space between two conductors.
//  One conductor attached to pin4, one to A0
//
//  Optionally, two resistors (1 MOhm or greater) can be placed between 5V and GND, with
//  the signal connected between them so that the steady-state voltage is 2.5 Volts.
//
//  Signal varies with electric field coupling between conductors, and can
//  be used to measure many things related to position, overlap, and intervening material
//  between the two conductors.
//



int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff;


void setup() {
pinMode(4,OUTPUT);      //Pin 4 provides the voltage step
Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {


   digitalWrite(4,HIGH);              //Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
   read_high = analogRead(A0);        //Measure response of conductor 2.
   delayMicroseconds(100);            //Delay to reach steady state.
   digitalWrite(4,LOW);               //Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
   read_low = analogRead(A0);         //Measure response of conductor 2.
   diff = read_high - read_low;       //desired answer is the difference between high and low.

Serial.println(diff);
//delay(100);



}

### Problems with the MacGyver Air Pressure Sensor

- The bottom cardboard platform wobbles and will lift up at an angle. I attempted to mitigate this using four lugnuts as balancing weights, but this did not completely eliminate the problem

- The diameter of the balloon does not increase linearly with the amount of air pressure being pumped into it

- The balloon will not maintain its structural integrity over time, making this sensor unreliable and needing to be recalibrated on a regular basis

The first problem can be fixed by building a more rigid structure using machined metal parts and some form of lubrication to make the platform rise smoother. Furthermore, the bottom platform can be turned into more of a cubic shape \(as opposed to a flat plate\) in order to eliminate the wobble. This could be constructed with a milling machine, a horizontal saw, and a lot of patience.

### Or I can just use this nice Differential Pressure Sensor Rob gave me

<img src="sensor.jpg" alt="pic2" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">

Using this sensor is really nice, but it creates a very spiky plot. In order to reduce this spikyness, I used this modified version of David Cuartielles's analog input code, which averages the values of the sensor over 150 samples.

```
/*
  Analog Input

  Demonstrates analog input by reading an analog sensor on analog pin 0 and
  turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13.
  The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on the value obtained
  by analogRead().

  The circuit:
  - potentiometer
    center pin of the potentiometer to the analog input 0
    one side pin (either one) to ground
    the other side pin to +5V
  - LED
    anode (long leg) attached to digital output 13
    cathode (short leg) attached to ground

  - Note: because most Arduinos have a built-in LED attached to pin 13 on the
    board, the LED is optional.

int sensorPin = A0;    // select the input pin for the potentiometer
int ledPin = 13;      // select the pin for the LED
int sensorValue = 0;  // variable to store the value coming from the sensor
int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff;
float sum;
int N_samples = 150;

void setup() {
  // declare the ledPin as an OUTPUT:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {

  sum = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++) {
    int sample = analogRead(A0);        //Measure response of conductor 2.
    delay(1);
    sum += sample;                       //Sums up N_samples of these measurements.
  }
  sum /= N_samples;
  Serial.println(sum-35);
  //delay(100);

}
```

Calibrating the differential pressure sensor was simply a matter of subtracting 35 from the sum, since the baseline value that the sensor outputs when the vacuum intake is sealed is 35.
