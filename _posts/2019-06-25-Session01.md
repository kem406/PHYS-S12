### Using a Transistor as a Switch

Today I learned how to use a transistor. A transistor acts as a sort of \"switch\" that can let a large current flow through after expending only a minimal amount of energy. Normally, transistors are used to allow current to flow through its drain and source leads after a small voltage is applied to its gate pin, but I wanted to try something more challenging and wire it so that the opposite happens: applying a signal deactivates the current flow through the drain and the source. In particular, I wanted to be able to press a pushbutton and turn off an LED as opposed to turning it on as a sort of \"inverse\" switch.

The schematic for the circuit is as follows:

I am powering my circuit with an Arduino Uno, which I can program to cause the LED to do some nifty tricks. The LED I want to turn off with my transistor is controlled by a pin that pulses, causing the light to flash. I also hooked up some red, green, and yellow LEDS to other pins (outside of the transistor circuit) in a \"traffic light\" configuration and programed the Arduino to alternate them.

Here is a video of the entire circuit in action:

The code I used is a modified version of Aurduino's sample code \"Blink:\"

```

int led_green=5;
int led_yellow=4;
int led_red=3;


// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the blue LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(100);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off
  delay(100);                       //etc.
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
  delay(100);                       
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(100);                      
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
  delay(100);                       
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(1000);                       
  digitalWrite(led_green, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_yellow, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_red, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_green, LOW);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_yellow, LOW);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_red, LOW);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
}

### Final Project Proposal

Inspired by [Nathan Melenbrink's](http://nathanmelenbrink.com/) explanation of soft robotics and their usage around coral reefs, I wanted to try making my own soft robotic gripper and attach it to a pneumatic robotic arm, similar to the one that appears in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lF_mJf8uo&t=1m11s) video.

The "gimmick" of this robot is that its physical movement will be entirely driven by air, as opposed to electromagnetic motors. I can use the McKibben Actuators that [Rob](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/) made and activate them using solenoid air valves, and the soft robotic gripper (details of which can be found [here](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/resources-for-educators/soft-gripper)) can be inflated using an air pump motor.  

Here is a sketch I made showcasing a possible configuration of the robot arm:

I will document the progress of my pneumatic arm on the [Final Project page](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/12/).
