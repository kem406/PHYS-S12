### Tool Usage

Today I learned the proper way to use several tools in the shop, including:

- Hacksaws vs traditional saws. We also used a Japanese variant
- Razor blades used to cut cardboard
- Drill Press
- Measuring tools \(for determining precision points for drilling\)
- Epoxy and other glues
- Heat gun

### Final Project Progress

Today I was able to find a working pneumatic motor and soldier two wires it and solidify their connections with heat-shrinked tubing.
