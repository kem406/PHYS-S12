Hi, I'm Ken. I'm an extension student at Harvard. I like physics.

This is my webpage for PHYS-S12: Introduction to Digital Fabrication

Final project proposals:

- A pneumatic robotic arm or walker
- Shoes that allow you to send static electric shocks through your fingertips
- Musical tesla coil
- Archemedean Death Ray
- Hand-held laser that can set things on fire
