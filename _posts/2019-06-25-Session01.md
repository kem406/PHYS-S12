### Website Design

Using the Jekyll theme that was provided to us, I constructed an [index.html](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/index.html) and [about](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/about/) page. The index page does not appear to be any different from my [normal home page](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/), but it still conveniently lists the links to all my assignments.

I customized my website using Matt Graham's [Leap Day theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/) for Github pages. I did a bit of tweaking by replacing some of the images and changing some of the links built into the theme. In particular, I changed the links on the yellow banner, which normally link to my changelog page and all my downloadables, to instead link to my Home and About pages. In other words, this:

```
<div id="banner">
  <span id="logo"></span>
  <a href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}" class="button fork"><strong>View On GitHub</strong></a>
  {% if site.show_downloads %}
    <div class="downloads">
      <span>Downloads:</span>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="{{ site.github.zip_url }}" class="button">ZIP</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{ site.github.tar_url }}" class="button">TAR</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  {% endif %}
</div><!-- end banner -->
```

was changed to this:

```
<div id="banner">
	<span id="logo"></span>
	<a href="https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/" class="button fork"><strong>Home</strong></a>
	{% if site.show_downloads %}
		<div class="downloads">
			<span> </span>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/about/" class="button">About</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/contact/" class="button">Contact</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	{% endif %}
</div><!-- end banner -->
```

I also took the liberty of constructing my own contact info page.

### Final Project Proposal

Inspired by [Nathan Melenbrink's](http://nathanmelenbrink.com/) explanation of soft robotics and their usage around coral reefs, I wanted to try making my own soft robotic gripper and attach it to a pneumatic robotic arm, similar to the one that appears in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lF_mJf8uo&t=1m11s) video.

The "gimmick" of this robot is that its physical movement will be entirely driven by air, as opposed to electromagnetic motors. I can use the McKibben Actuators that [Rob](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/) made and activate them using solenoid air valves, and the soft robotic gripper (details of which can be found [here](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/resources-for-educators/soft-gripper)) can be inflated using an air pump motor.  

Here is a sketch I made showcasing a possible configuration of the robot arm:

I will document the progress of my pneumatic arm on the [Final Project page](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/12/).
