### Controlling the Air Valves

I created a circuit for the Arduino Nano that allows me to control two air valves with two pushbuttons. Each pushbutton activates one of the solenoid valves and lights up an LED (blue for air pressure, yellow for release like in [05: Programmablee Electronics](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/05/)). If both pushbuttons are pressed at the same time, a red LED will light and a buzzer will sound, since this would be an invalid command (i.e. commanding the robot arm to move up and down at the same time), and would waste air.

Here is the program I used:

### Making an Elbow

I connected my circuit and air valves to a rudimentary setup I made for my robotic arm's elbow.

As you can see, pressing one button causes one valve to open (allowing air from the tank to fill the McKibben actuator), while pressing the other button opens the pressure release valve (causing air to evacuate the actuator). Pressing both buttons at the same time plays a warning sound and ceases all movement of the arm.
