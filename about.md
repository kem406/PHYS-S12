Hi, I'm Ken. I'm a computer science major on my way towards getting a degree at Harvard. You can view my other projects [here](http://kenmichalek.com).

I currently work for the Harvard physics department in both the Science Center fabrication lab (where this course takes place) and the [Physics/SEAS Instructional Machine Shop](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/resources/shop). My goal is to graduate with a strong background in topics related to robotics, from electromechanical engineering to machine learning to nanoscale systems.

Information about this course can be found [here](https://www.summer.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses/introduction-to-digital-fabrication/34524), and the 2019 summer course specifically can be found [here](https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/about.html).
