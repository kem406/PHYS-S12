Hi, I'm Ken. I'm a computer science concentrator on my way towards getting a degree at Harvard. In the past, I was a physics major at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My work has mostly been involved with machining. I currently work for the Harvard physics department in Lyman lab, where I supervise the after-hours of the [SEAS Instructional Machine Shop](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/resources/shop) managed by Stan Cotreau and Andy DiMambro. In the past, I've also had the opportunity of working at the Sears-Roebeck headquarters (before they declared bankruptcy), and I've been involved with search and rescue work related to the Air Force.

I am highly interested in both physics and robotics, and even though I am a comp sci major, it is my goal to take as many physics classes as humanly possible before I graduate. Therefore, this class was a no-brainer, as it has both of those things in abundance.
