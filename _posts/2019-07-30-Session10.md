# 10: Molding & Casting

### Assignment

Design a 3D mold, machine it, and cast material in it.

### Creating a Miniature Soft Gripper

At first, I used the tiny mold I 3D printed in [session 6](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06) to try making a soft gripper.

I poured a substance called Ecoflex silicone into the mold, which involves mixing two different parts A and B into a single cup before pouring. After the mold cured in about four hours, I ended up with a nice looking upper half of a soft gripper:

I mixed up some more Ecoflex and tried using it as glue to attach the upper half to a piece of silicone that already had some fabric attached to it, but the resulting soft gripper did not work whatsoever. I think the problem with it was two-fold: one, I used too much of the Ecoflex to glue the pieces together, causing some to get into the air cavities; and two, the mold I used was really tiny and therefore already did not have much air space to work with in the first place.

### Creating a Larger Yellow Gripper

I wanted to make my soft grippers more attractive-looking, so I used something called Silc Pig to dye the Ecoflex bight yellow. I bought the Silc Pig from Reynolds Advanced Materials in Brighton, and according to the staff there, it works best when you mix it in with part B of the Ecoflex before you combine both parts.

For the fabric, I laser cut some yellow nylon I found in the fabric bin. I cut it to the same exact dimensions as the lower half mold I designed in session 6.

This fabric fit snugly into the bottom mold.

I poured the Silc-Pig dyed Ecoflex into both this mold and the larger upper half mold from session 6:

I then left these to cure for roughly four hours.
