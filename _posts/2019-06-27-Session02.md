# 02: Basic tools, procedures, and electronics

### Assignment

- Cut pieces from two different materials and join them. Document this.
- Add a fabricated component to a circuit, so that it does something (motion or light).
- Use a multimeter to measure the behavior of your circuit. Document your work and learning.
- Sign up for a free student Fusion 360 account with Autodesk

### Tool Usage

Today I learned the proper way to use several tools in the shop, including:

- Hacksaws vs traditional saws. We also used a Japanese variant
- Razor blades used to cut cardboard
- Drill Press
- Measuring tools \(for determining precision points for drilling\)
- Filer
- Epoxy and other glues
- Heat gun

### Preparing a Water Pump Motor for Use

Using a razor, I cut some wire and heat shrink tubing. I then stripped the wires using a wire stripper (very appropriate name), and after soldering the wires to the leads of the motor (a skill that I learned in session 1), I used the heat gun to shrink the tubing around the solder points. This increases the robustness of the soldering connections I made, and now the motor is ready to be utilized.

### Using an air pump to inflate a balloon

I prepared an air pump motor in the same way, and used a power supply to use the motor to inflate a balloon:

### Creating a Brass spacer

I used a hack saw to cut some brass tubing into a spacer that I could use to connect two aluminum bars that I will use for my final project robot. I also used the hack saw to cut a brass threaded rod, and used it in conjunction to the spacer to join the two aluminum bars.

### Creating a PVC Stand for my Robot

Since I work at the [SEAS Instructional Machine Shop](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/resources/shop), I have access to a very nice tool known as a horizontal saw. It is ideal for cutting round objects (which a standard band saw has trouble cutting), and it can even be automated.

I used the horizontal saw to cut some PVC which I used to make a quick and dirty stand for my pneumatic robot arm, so I don't have to waste time finding one that's high enough or build my own out of wood.

I then attached an 80/20 slotted aluminum rod to the top of the stand. This is where I will pivot my robot arm off of. In order to do this, I drilled two holes in two adjacent pipes, and then cut (using the hack saw) and filed down some long screws with a belt sander, so they could fit into a nut just inside the 80/20 slot.

### Connecting the Soft Gripper to an Air Tube

So far, the only way to inflate the soft gripper is using the air syringe. I want to be able to control it using the air pump motor. To do this, I used a razor blade to cut some air tube, and I also cut the tip off of a bottle nozzle, which I can fit the tube around. I can then jam the tube into the opening in the Soft Gripper, since the nozzle acts as a syringe needle. 

### Using a Transistor as a Switch

This circuit was actually made during our very first lab section, but I thought it would be more appropriate to document it here.

A transistor acts as a sort of \"switch\" that can let a large current flow through after expending only a minimal amount of energy. Normally, transistors are used to allow current to flow through its drain and source leads after a small voltage is applied to its gate pin, but I wanted to try something more challenging and wire it so that the opposite happens: applying a signal deactivates the current flow through the drain and the source. In particular, I wanted to be able to press a pushbutton and turn off an LED as opposed to turning it on as a sort of \"inverse\" switch.

The schematic for the circuit is as follows:

<img src="circuit1.png" alt="Circuit" >

I am powering my circuit with an Arduino Uno, which I can program to cause the LED to do some nifty tricks. The LED I want to turn off with my transistor is controlled by a pin that pulses, causing the light to flash. I also hooked up some red, green, and yellow LEDS to other pins (outside of the transistor circuit) in a \"traffic light\" configuration and programed the Arduino to alternate them.

Here is a video of the entire circuit in action:

The code I used is a modified version of Aurduino's sample code \"Blink:\"

```

int led_green=5;
int led_yellow=4;
int led_red=3;


// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the blue LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(100);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off
  delay(100);                       //etc.
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
  delay(100);                       
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(100);                      
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
  delay(100);                       
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(1000);                       
  digitalWrite(led_green, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_yellow, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_red, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_green, LOW);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_yellow, LOW);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_red, LOW);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
}

```
