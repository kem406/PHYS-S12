### How To Use a Transistor as a Switch

Today I had the opportunity to use an Arduino-powered breadboard to create a circuit that utilizes a transistor to act as an inverse switch. The default state of the LED current is on, but when a pressure switch is activated the LED turns off.

The schematic for this circuit is as follows:

I also programmed the Arduino Nano with a simple code that causes the blue LED to flash three times in a cycle. I also borrowed the code from another student to light a series of Red, Green, and Yellow LEDs to light up in succession, similar to a traffic light. The transistor and pressure switch still turn off the blue LED, though they do not affect the part of the circuit that controls the \"traffic light\"

Here is a video of the transistor switch and lights in action:
