# Final Project

A lot of the previous sessions focused on progress of the robot, so they will be repeated on this page.

### Final Project Proposal

Inspired by [Nathan Melenbrink's](http://nathanmelenbrink.com/) explanation of soft robotics and their usage around coral reefs, I wanted to try making my own soft robotic gripper and attach it to a pneumatic robotic arm, similar to the one that appears in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1lF_mJf8uo&t=1m11s) video.

The "gimmick" of this robot is that its physical movement will be entirely driven by air, as opposed to electromagnetic motors. I can use the McKibben Actuators that [Rob](https://roberthart56.github.io/SCFAB/SC_lab/) made and activate them using solenoid air valves, and the soft robotic gripper (details of which can be found [here](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/resources-for-educators/soft-gripper)) can be inflated using an air pump motor.  

Here is a sketch I made showcasing a possible configuration of the robot arm:

### Creating a PVC Stand for my Robot

Since I work at the [SEAS Instructional Machine Shop](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/resources/shop), I have access to a very nice tool known as a horizontal saw. It is ideal for cutting round objects (which a standard band saw has trouble cutting), and it can even be automated.

I used the horizontal saw to cut some PVC which I used to make a quick and dirty stand for my pneumatic robot arm, so I don't have to waste time finding one that's high enough or build my own out of wood.

### 3D Printing a Mold for the Soft Gripper

The existing soft gripper did not pump air uniformly into its four fingers, which I suspect is a result of imperfections due to the silicone not being distributed uniformly during the molding process. To fix this problem, I decided to 3D print my own mold, which should be much more rigid compared to the cardboard and hot-glue mold suggested by the Soft Robotics Toolkit website.

Luckily, I found that someone had already conveniently designed a mold for this very gripper and freely offered the .stl file on [their blog](https://www.instructables.com/id/Air-Powered-Soft-Robotic-Gripper/). Therefore, it was just a matter of converting this file using Cura and feeding it into the Prusa 3D printer:

</video>

Unfortunately, the 3D printer had some issues printing the mold, as you can see in the video. The mold was printed off-center, and a portion of the "support raft" was missing on the bottom, causing the mold to come out misaligned:

It turned out the problem was the 3D slicer I was using. The Ultimaker Cura doesn't seem to like slicing things for the Prusa MK3, so I resliced it using the Prusa Slicer instead. After all, it would make sense to use the slicer made for the specific printer I'm using.

This time, the mold printed correctly, as you can see by the mold appearing in the middle and being within the printed boundary markers. The mold turned out pretty nicely:

However, the gripper that would result from this mold would be really tiny. I experimented with changing the size on the Prusa Slicer to produce larger variants of this mold.

I also designed my own mold in Fusion 360 for the bottom half of the soft gripper, which is simply a cross roughly in the same dimensions as the largest version of the upper-half mold. You can download an .stl of this mold [here](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06/gripperfoot.stl).

While 3D printing the air-hose connector was done more in the interest of time than anything else, I think a good case can be made for justifying the 3D printing of the molds. As I said earlier, I need the mold to be as precise as possible, and I don't think making one out of cardboard would cut it. 3D printing the bottom half also allows me to save time and not have to worry about using a knife to cut out a perfect cross shape from a larger sheet of silicone.

### 3D Printing Miscellaneous Parts

I 3D printed some various parts to use for my final project. These include two clamping mechanisms for my arm, a tube stopper, and a cylindrical spacer (.stl downloads [here](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06/clamp1.stl), [here](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06/clamp2.stl), [here](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06/stopper.stl) and [here](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06/spacer.stl) respectively).

Clamping mechanism:

Stopper:

Spacer:

The spacer and the stopper turned out nice, and I made them in some pretty blue and yellow colors to boot. I also printed out a blue version of the air-hose connector.

I replaced the brass spacer I made for [session 2](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/02/) with the 3D printed version, since I would prefer the spacer to be precisely even, which is hard to achieve by filing a brass spacer down, and machining a perfect spacer with a mill would be time consuming (in contrast, the 3D printer made what I needed in a few minutes!).

However, the clamp did not turn out well. For some reason, the printer lost its grip on the filament and went through the rest of the printing motions without actually printing the rest of the object. I suppose this is for the best, since the part needs to be at 100% infill because of the stress this clamp would be under, and that would have wasted a lot of material. My only justification for printing this particular part is that the 3D printer is the only tool I have access to outside of lab hours.

I opted to machine the clamp instead, which you can be read about in [session 11](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/11/).
