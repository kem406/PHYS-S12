Hi, I'm Ken. I'm a computer science concentrator on my way towards getting a degree at Harvard.

My work experience has mostly been related to machining. I currently work for the Harvard physics department in Lyman lab, where I manage the after-hours of the [SEAS Instructional Machine Shop](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/resources/shop) run by Stan Cotreau and Andy DiMambro. In the past, I had a corporate headquarters job at Sears-Roebeck (before they declared bankruptcy), and I've also been involved with search and rescue work related to the Air Force.

I am highly interested in both physics and robotics, so this class was an obvious choice. It is my goal to have a well-rounded background in robotics by the time I graduate, from engineering to machine learning to nanoscale systems.

In my free time, I enjoy kayaking, playing the guitar, listening to 80s music, and reading about Babylonian astronomy.
