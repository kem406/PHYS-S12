### Assignment

- Cut pieces from two different materials and join them. Document this.
- Add a fabricated component to a circuit, so that it does something (motion or light).
- Use a multimeter to measure the behavior of your circuit. Document your work and learning.
- Sign up for a free student Fusion 360 account with Autodesk

### Tool Usage

Today I learned the proper way to use several tools in the shop, including:

- Hacksaws vs traditional saws. We also used a Japanese variant
- Razor blades used to cut cardboard
- Drill Press
- Measuring tools \(for determining precision points for drilling\)
- Filer
- Epoxy and other glues
- Heat gun

### Preparing a Water Pump Motor for Use

Using a razor, I cut some wire and heat shrink tubing. I then stripped the wires using a wire stripper (very appropriate name), and after soldering the wires to the leads of the motor (a skill that I learned in week 1), I used the heat gun to shrink the tubing around the solder points. This increases the robustness of the soldering connections I made, and now the motor is ready utilized.

### Final Project Progress

Today I was able to find a working pneumatic motor and soldier two wires it and solidify their connections with heat-shrinked tubing.

Unfortunately it took some time to find a working motor so I did not have enough time to do enough testing with it, however I was able to hook it up to the 5v and ground pins of the Aurduino board to verify that it worked.

I was not able to test the motor with the pneumatic tubing.

### Using a Transistor as a Switch

A transistor acts as a sort of \"switch\" that can let a large current flow through after expending only a minimal amount of energy. Normally, transistors are used to allow current to flow through its drain and source leads after a small voltage is applied to its gate pin, but I wanted to try something more challenging and wire it so that the opposite happens: applying a signal deactivates the current flow through the drain and the source. In particular, I wanted to be able to press a pushbutton and turn off an LED as opposed to turning it on as a sort of \"inverse\" switch.

The schematic for the circuit is as follows:

I am powering my circuit with an Arduino Uno, which I can program to cause the LED to do some nifty tricks. The LED I want to turn off with my transistor is controlled by a pin that pulses, causing the light to flash. I also hooked up some red, green, and yellow LEDS to other pins (outside of the transistor circuit) in a \"traffic light\" configuration and programed the Arduino to alternate them.

Here is a video of the entire circuit in action:

The code I used is a modified version of Aurduino's sample code \"Blink:\"

```

int led_green=5;
int led_yellow=4;
int led_red=3;


// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the blue LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(100);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turn the LED off
  delay(100);                       //etc.
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
  delay(100);                       
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(100);                      
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   
  delay(100);                       
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    
  delay(1000);                       
  digitalWrite(led_green, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_yellow, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_red, HIGH);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_green, LOW);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_yellow, LOW);
  delay(200);
  digitalWrite(led_red, LOW);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
}

```
