# 06: 3D Design & Printing

### Assignment

1. Design and print a small object that could not be (easily) made by subtractive methods. Discuss pros and cons of 3D printing this object rather than using other fabrication methods.

2. Scan something.

3. Please read the following to preview for next week:

### 3D Printing an Air Hose Connector

Rather than spending the five dollars needed to buy one of these connectors, I decided to try to 3D print my own by designing it in Fusion 360:

<img src="connector.png" alt="Connector" style="height: 200px; max-width: 48%">

I made this shape by making two circles within each other and extruding this into the third dimension. With the use of some construction lines, I created a hole in the center of the tube and repeated the process at a 90 degree angle. I then converted this model into an .stl file, and then used the Cura program to convert it into an Ultimaker file. I then used an SD card to give this file to the Ultimaker 3D printer:

Unfortunately, the finished part leaked air and did not serve as a suitable replacement for the part I can buy. I will try again on Friday using a thicker tube diameter to see if this will prevent leaking.

My STL file can be downloaded [here](https://kem406.github.io/PHYS-S12/06/triconnector2.stl).

### 3D Printing a Mold for the Soft Gripper

The existing soft gripper did not pump air uniformly into its four fingers, which I suspect is a result of imperfections due to the silicone not being distributed uniformly during the molding process. To fix this problem, I decided to 3D print my own mold, which should be much more rigid compared to the cardboard and hot-glue mold suggested by the Soft Robotics Toolkit website.

Luckily, I found that someone had already conveniently designed a mold for this very gripper and freely offered the .stl file on [their blog](https://www.instructables.com/id/Air-Powered-Soft-Robotic-Gripper/). Therefore, it was just a matter of converting this file using Cura and feeding it into the Prusa 3D printer:

Hopefully, I will be able to cast the mold itself on Friday.
