### Tool Usage

Today I learned the proper way to use several tools in the shop, including:

- Hacksaws vs traditional saws. We also used a Japanese variant
- Razor blades used to cut cardboard
- Drill Press
- Measuring tools \(for determining precision points for drilling\)
- Filer
- Epoxy and other glues
- Heat gun

### Final Project Progress

Today I was able to find a working pneumatic motor and soldier two wires it and solidify their connections with heat-shrinked tubing.

Unfortunately it took some time to find a working motor so I did not have enough time to do enough testing with it, however I was able to hook it up to the 5v and ground pins of the Aurduino board to verify that it worked.

I was not able to test the motor with the pneumatic tubing.
